  PENDING RELEASE-NOTES SNIPPET (published: false — not linked from the site nav).

  This page holds the ready-to-ship release notes for the OPTIONAL PostgreSQL thing-search backend. The Ditto
  version that will carry this feature is not decided yet (latest cut release is 3.9.0 — release_notes_390.md),
  so this content is staged here, next to the versioned release-notes pages, rather than in a versioned file.
  When the version is decided, fold the sections below into that release's release_notes_<version>.md and either
  delete this page or flip published:true if a standalone landing page is wanted.

  @since tags across the new surface assume the next release is 3.10.0 — adjust together with this note if the
  version differs.

Eclipse Ditto's **thing-search** service can now **optionally** run its search index on **PostgreSQL** instead of
MongoDB. MongoDB remains the default search backend — this is strictly opt-in and independent of which backend the
persistence services (things / policies / connectivity) use. See
[Installation / extending — PostgreSQL search backend](installation-extending.html#postgresql-search-backend) for the
setup steps.

## Deployment — three-JAR extension matrix

The PostgreSQL backend now ships as **layered drop-in JARs** rather than a single shaded JAR. A shared **base** JAR
carries all third-party runtime; **thin** JARs carry only Ditto implementation classes:

| JAR | Contents | Mounted by |
|-----|----------|------------|
| `ditto-postgres-client-extension` (base) | shared `postgres-client` infra + ALL third-party (r2dbc-postgresql, r2dbc-pool, reactor, netty incl. resolver-dns, scram) | every Postgres service |
| `ditto-postgres-persistence-extension` (thin) | event-sourcing persistence classes only | things / policies / connectivity |
| `ditto-postgres-search-extension` (thin) | thing-search classes only | thing-search (only if search runs on Postgres) |

Deployment matrix:

* **things / policies / connectivity on Postgres:** mount **base + persistence** (2 JARs). **This is a change from the
  earlier single `ditto-internal-utils-persistence-r2dbc-extension` JAR** — a persistence service on Postgres now
  mounts two JARs instead of one.
* **thing-search on Postgres:** mount **base + search** (2 JARs). A search service left on MongoDB mounts nothing.
* All mounted Postgres extension JARs **must come from the same Ditto release** — a boot self-check (a version marker
  in each JAR) fails fast on a mismatch, and a thin JAR mounted without its base fails fast with an actionable
  "requires base `ditto-postgres-client-extension`" error.

## Prerequisite — the `pg_trgm` extension

The PostgreSQL search schema requires the `pg_trgm` extension (used for the `like`/`ilike` trigram indexes). It is a
*trusted* extension on PostgreSQL ≥ 13, so `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm` on the target database succeeds
for the DDL role without superuser privileges. The schema bootstrap fails with an actionable error if the role is not
permitted to create it.

## Migration — re-index cutover (no copy tooling)

The search index is a **rebuildable projection** of the things data, so there is no data-migration step and no copy
tooling. The cutover to PostgreSQL is: point the search service at an empty PostgreSQL database and let the
**background-sync** stream regenerate the index. Search results are **incomplete until the initial re-index finishes**
— plan this re-index window into the cutover. The same mechanism is the recovery path if the index is ever lost.

## `like`/`ilike` performance — known limitation

Sub-3-character `like`/`ilike` patterns cannot be served by a trigram index and degrade to a scan — this mirrors
MongoDB's own unanchored-regex degradation and is caught by the existing slow-query log. Separately, high-cardinality
paths queried with `ilike` remain slower than the point-lookup shapes under the single global trigram index. Per-path
scoped trigram indexes are **under evaluation** as a possible future mitigation (see the benchmark-results
investigation) — this release does **not** adopt a scoped-index design and the trade-off remains open; the current
behavior is documented here as a known limitation, not a settled acceptance.

## Mongo-only search knobs ignored on PostgreSQL

Search configuration specific to MongoDB — for example per-metric MongoDB index hints and configurable custom MongoDB
search indexes — is **ignored (logged with a WARN)** when the PostgreSQL search backend is active. These knobs have no
PostgreSQL analog and are safely left in place for Mongo-search deployments.

## Background-sync and updater-stream settings — unchanged on PostgreSQL

The `ditto.search.updater.*` settings listed here (`event-processing-active`, `background-sync.enabled` /
`quiet-period` / `tolerance-window`, `stream.write-interval`, the `policy-cache` / `thing-cache` `retry-delay`s) are
consumed by the backend-neutral updater layer and behave identically on PostgreSQL; the `ditto-postgres-search`
profile defines no `ditto.search.*` key. The background-sync bookmark is persisted as a single row in the
`search_sync` table and the tolerance-window comparison uses the thing's `_modified` timestamp stored in
`search_things.t_modified`. `stream.persistence.with-acks-writeConcern` is a MongoDB write concern and has no effect
on PostgreSQL.

Independent of the backend, `search.conf` now binds `THINGS_SEARCH_UPDATER_STREAM_THING_CACHE_RETRY_DELAY` to
`ditto.search.updater.stream.thing-cache.retry-delay`; previously that environment variable was silently ignored
(the `policy-cache` counterpart was already bound). Note that `stream.policy-cache.retry-delay` is parsed but not
consumed by the enforcement flow (only the thing-cache delay is), and `event-processing-active=false` only logs a
warning — both are long-standing service-level behaviours, unrelated to the storage backend.

## Write-acknowledgement divergence for no-change re-writes

One behavioral divergence is scoped to **write acknowledgements only and never affects query results**: when a thing
update maps to no actual storage change, MongoDB computes an incremental diff and — finding it empty — skips the write
and dispatches a **weak** acknowledgement, whereas PostgreSQL performs its unconditional doc-row upsert and returns a
**normal (strong) success** acknowledgement instead; both backends persist identical index state, so search results are
unaffected.

## Breaking change — `SearchUpdateMapper` re-typed to the neutral write model

`SearchUpdateMapper` (the `search-update-mapper` extension point) no longer works on the MongoDB-specific
`MongoWriteModel`. It is now typed against the **backend-neutral**
`org.eclipse.ditto.thingsearch.persistence.api.model.AbstractWriteModel`. This change is **binary- and
source-breaking** for custom implementations, but it is **japicmp-invisible**: `ditto-thingsearch-service` is not a
japicmp-gated module (services are not binary-compatibility-checked), so no build-breaking japicmp diff will surface
it — these release notes are the only record of the break for downstream custom-mapper authors.

New signature:

```java
public abstract class SearchUpdateMapper implements DittoExtensionPoint {
    protected final ActorSystem actorSystem;
    protected SearchUpdateMapper(final ActorSystem actorSystem, final Config config);
    public abstract Source<org.eclipse.ditto.thingsearch.persistence.api.model.AbstractWriteModel, NotUsed>
        processWriteModel(org.eclipse.ditto.thingsearch.persistence.api.model.AbstractWriteModel writeModel,
                          org.eclipse.ditto.thingsearch.persistence.api.model.AbstractWriteModel lastWriteModel);
    public static SearchUpdateMapper get(final ActorSystem actorSystem, final Config config);
}
```

Removed from the old (Mongo-typed) API: the `protected final int maxWireVersion` field, the
`SearchUpdateMapper(ActorSystem, Integer)` constructor, the private `getMaxWireVersion(ActorSystem)` helper (which
probed `MongoClientExtension.get(...).getUpdaterClient().getMaxWireVersion()`), and the
`protected Source<MongoWriteModel, NotUsed> toIncrementalMongo(...)` helper. The abstract method's element type
changed from `MongoWriteModel` to the neutral `AbstractWriteModel`. A custom mapper is now simply a neutral
write-model → write-model transform; the bundled default (`DefaultSearchUpdateMapper.processWriteModel(...)`) is the
identity function (`return Source.single(writeModel);`).

**Migration for custom `search-update-mapper` implementations:** re-type the override to the neutral
`AbstractWriteModel`; any Mongo-specific manipulation (BSON diffing, wire-version probing) must move behind the
(Mongo-only) `SearchUpdaterFlow` seam — it is no longer available at the mapper extension point.

## `SearchUpdateObserver` — documented, but no code change required

`SearchUpdateObserver` (the `search-update-observer` extension point) was flagged in the design as a breaking change,
but its public surface was **already backend-neutral** and required **no code change**:

```java
public interface SearchUpdateObserver extends DittoExtensionPoint {
    void process(final Metadata metadata, @Nullable final JsonObject thingJson);
    static SearchUpdateObserver get(final ActorSystem actorSystem, final Config config);
}
```

(`Metadata` here is `org.eclipse.ditto.thingsearch.persistence.api.model.Metadata`.) No migration needed for custom
observers.

## New extension point — `ditto.extensions.search-persistence-provider`

Thing-search's persistence backend is now pluggable via a new `DittoExtensionPoint`, `SearchPersistenceProvider`
(`org.eclipse.ditto.thingsearch.persistence.api`). The bundled default (`MongoSearchPersistenceProvider`) is unchanged
behavior — MongoDB remains the out-of-the-box thing-search backend. The PostgreSQL search extension JAR swaps this
FQCN to its own provider via the opt-in `ditto-postgres-search` config profile; no action is required for existing
Mongo deployments.

## Non-breaking addition — `PredicateVisitor.visitLikeWithWildcards`

`org.eclipse.ditto.rql.query.criteria.visitors.PredicateVisitor<T>` gained new **default** methods giving raw wildcard
access to `like`/`ilike` predicates, for backends (such as the SQL/trigram-index PostgreSQL backend) that need the
un-translated wildcard pattern rather than the Mongo-regex-translated form. Because the additions are `default`
methods, this is japicmp-safe (source- and binary-compatible). No migration needed for existing `PredicateVisitor`
implementers; they inherit the default behavior automatically.
