/**
 * Layered-extension boot self-check for the thin Postgres <em>persistence</em> extension jar (§6 D2).
 * <p>
 * The thin {@code ditto-postgres-persistence-extension} jar carries only the persistence-r2dbc classes; the shared
 * {@code ditto-postgres-client-extension} base jar (r2dbc/reactor/netty runtime + postgres-client infra, including the
 * version-marker check {@code PostgresExtensionVersions}) MUST be mounted alongside it. This helper verifies that at
 * provider construction and produces an actionable error when the base is missing.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Why reflection.</strong> The base is referenced ONLY by name via {@link Class#forName}, never as a compiled
 * symbol. That keeps this tiny class verifiable and loadable even when the base jar is absent (a class that referenced a
 * base type directly would fail JVM verification with a bare {@code NoClassDefFoundError} before this guard could run).
 * So when the base is missing, {@code Class.forName} throws a caught {@link ClassNotFoundException} and we rethrow a
 * clear {@link IllegalStateException} naming the missing base jar; when the base is present we invoke its
 * {@code PostgresExtensionVersions.verifyConsistent()} and surface any same-release-mismatch error verbatim.
 *
 * @since 3.10.0
