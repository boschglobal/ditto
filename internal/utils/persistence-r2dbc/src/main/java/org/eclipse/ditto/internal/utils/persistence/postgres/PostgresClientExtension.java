/**
 * Actor-system {@link Extension} that owns the single, shared {@link DittoPostgresClient} (and therefore the single
 * R2DBC {@code ConnectionPool}) for a Ditto service.
 * <p>
 * This mirrors {@code MongoClientExtension} (the Mongo backend's one-client-per-actor-system seam): a Ditto service
 * persists a single entity type per actor system, and its journal, snapshot-store and read-journal plugins all talk to
 * the same PostgreSQL backend. Before this extension existed, {@code PostgresJournal(Config)}, {@code
 * PostgresSnapshotStore(Config)} and {@code PostgresPersistenceBackendProvider.getReadJournal()} each called
 * {@link DittoPostgresClient#newInstance} independently, so one service instance opened up to <strong>3 ×
 * {@code pool.max-size}</strong> connections — three times what {@code ditto-postgres-persistence.conf} documents {@code max-size}
 * to mean (the per-service total). Resolving the client through this extension collapses those three pools into one.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The pool is built lazily on first {@link #getClient()} (the extension instance itself is created the first time any of
 * the three plugins resolves it) and is registered <strong>once</strong> with {@link CoordinatedShutdown} so it is
 * gracefully drained on a rolling restart — closing the gap that per-plugin {@code postStop()} disposal left (Pekko does
 * not guarantee a plugin actor's {@code postStop} runs before dispatcher teardown).
 * </p>
