/**
 * Backend-neutral factory for the persistence-operations collaborators (namespace purge / entity purge) of an entity
 * type.
 * <p>
 * Each service's {@code RootActor} starts exactly one persistence-operations actor that performs namespace- and
 * entity-level purges against the active backend. Today that actor is produced backend-specifically: e.g.
 * {@code ConnectionPersistenceOperationsActor.props(...)} wraps a Mongo {@code MongoEntitiesPersistenceOperations}
 * (implementing {@code EntityPersistenceOperations}) inside an {@code AbstractPersistenceOperationsActor}. This factory
 * hoists the "build the ops collaborators for an entity type" step behind the {@link PersistenceBackendProvider} so a
 * {@code RootActor} can wire the ops actor without naming a backend.
 * <p>
 * The factory yields a backend-neutral {@link PersistenceOperationsCollaborators} bundle — the
 * {@code NamespacePersistenceOperations} / {@code EntityPersistenceOperations} an ops actor needs plus the
 * {@code Closeable} it must close on {@code postStop} — rather than a Pekko {@code Props}, because the ops actor types
 * live in the SERVICE modules and a factory in a backend module cannot build their {@code Props} without a Maven cycle.
 * The {@code RootActor} (C2) feeds this bundle into the existing service ops actor. The Mongo implementation (B2)
 * builds the collaborators around a fresh {@code MongoClientWrapper}; the Postgres implementation (E2) supplies its own.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Laziness:</strong> {@link #operations(String)} constructs the backend client (e.g. a
 * {@code MongoClientWrapper}) per call. It MUST therefore be invoked lazily — at ops-actor instantiation time, not when
 * the {@code Props} is built — exactly where the client is constructed today. Callers must not cache or share the
 * returned collaborators across ops actors; each ops actor owns and closes its own {@link #operations(String)} bundle.
 *
 * @since 3.7.0
