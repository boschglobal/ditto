/**
 * The PostgreSQL {@code delete_at} reaper (plan §3.6) — the in-service replacement for Mongo's TTL index on
 * {@code deleteAt}. C3's namespace {@code purge} only MARKS rows ({@code delete_at = to_timestamp(0)}); reads never
 * filter {@code delete_at} (Mongo parity — only {@code sudoStreamMetadata} does), so marked rows accumulate until
 * something actually deletes them. This class is that something.
 * <p>
 * <strong>One tick, verbatim:</strong>
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>open a connection, begin a transaction;</li>
 *     <li>{@code SELECT pg_try_advisory_xact_lock($1)} — non-blocking, transaction-scoped (auto-released on commit or
 *     rollback regardless of what happens to the pooled connection afterwards; see the single-runner note below). If
 *     not acquired, another reaper instance (this JVM or another replica) is mid-tick: skip, commit the (no-op)
 *     transaction, release the connection — {@link TickResult#lockAcquired()} is {@code false};</li>
 *     <li>otherwise, run {@link ReaperDrainLoop#run} with a batch-deleter bound to this connection executing the
 *     plan-mandated SQL ({@link #DELETE_BATCH_SQL}) until drained or the safety valve trips;</li>
 *     <li>commit (releasing the advisory lock) and close the connection.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Single-runner design (advisory lock vs. cluster singleton):</strong> a Pekko cluster singleton would also
 * guarantee exactly one active reaper cluster-wide, but needs cluster sharding/singleton infrastructure this module has
 * no reason to depend on. A Postgres advisory lock is simpler and dependency-free: it is enforced by the database
 * itself, works whether the search-updater service runs as one instance or many, and needs nothing beyond the
 * connection pool this module already has. <strong>Transaction-scoped, not session-scoped</strong> — deliberately
 * mirroring {@code PostgresSchemaManager}'s {@code ADVISORY_LOCK_KEY} rationale: a session-scoped
 * {@code pg_advisory_lock}/{@code pg_advisory_unlock} pair is unsafe here because {@code r2dbc-pool}'s
 * {@link Connection#close()} returns the physical connection to the pool rather than closing the TCP session — an
 * un-released (or exception-skipped) session lock would then persist on that pooled physical backend connection
 * indefinitely, silently jamming every future reaper tick that happens to borrow it. {@code pg_try_advisory_xact_lock}
 * auto-releases at commit/rollback no matter what, so it cannot leak across pooled-connection reuse.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The advisory-lock key ({@link #ADVISORY_LOCK_KEY}) is a dedicated constant, distinct from
 * {@code PostgresSchemaManager.ADVISORY_LOCK_KEY} (the shared first-boot bootstrap lock, {@code 0x0D17_70_5C_4E_4AL}) —
 * the two lock different things (schema bootstrap vs. ongoing reap ticks) and must never collide.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 3.10.0
