/**
 * The single source of truth for turning JSON object keys / pointers into the {@code search_flat} {@code path}/
 * {@code wpath} TEXT columns' segment encoding (RFC 6901), shared by BOTH the write side ({@code ThingFlattener},
 * which escapes each raw JSON key as it walks the tree) and the read side (the Phase-D RQL→SQL translator, which
 * escapes each queried path segment before comparing against those columns).
 * <p>
 * Keeping this in one place is a correctness obligation, not a convenience: if the two sides ever diverged by one
 * character, a query would silently probe a wpath the writer never emitted and return no rows. Task D2 relocated the
 * escaping here from {@code ThingFlattener} (which now delegates) so the translator and the flattener are literally
 * the same code.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Escaping vs. auth paths:</b> this encoding applies ONLY to the flat-table {@code path}/{@code wpath} columns,
 * which are single TEXT values with {@code '/'} as the sole segment separator. The JSONB auth trees
 * ({@code policy_auth}/{@code features_auth}) are addressed with {@code #>}/{@code jsonb_extract_path} using
 * <em>raw</em> (un-escaped) key segments bound as {@code text[]}/{@code text} — so callers building auth paths must
 * NOT use this class (see {@code AuthFilterSqlBuilder}). Ditto's own {@link JsonPointer} API side-steps the slash
 * ambiguity via the {@link JsonKey} type and therefore only documents tilde escaping; the flat columns cannot, so
 * both {@code '~'} and {@code '/'} are escaped here.
 * </p>
