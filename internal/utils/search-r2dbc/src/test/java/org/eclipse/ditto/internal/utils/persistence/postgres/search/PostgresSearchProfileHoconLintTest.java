/**
 * HOCON lint over the effective {@code ditto-postgres-search.conf} profile (Phase F requirement 2) — the
 * search-specific counterpart to {@code PostgresProfileHoconLintTest} (persistence-r2dbc).
 * <p>
 * <strong>Why this is NOT a copy of the persistence lint.</strong> That test's positive anchor is the per-service
 * Pekko auto-start journal/snapshot-store IDs ({@code pekko.persistence.journal.auto-start-journals} etc.) — the
 * search backend is not a Pekko-persistence journal plugin at all (it has no journal/snapshot-store), so those config
 * paths simply do not exist for search; asserting them would either be vacuously true (path absent, no assertion run)
 * or actively wrong. The Phase F brief is explicit about this: anchor on the PROVIDER CLASS SET instead. Likewise, this
 * test does NOT assert a naive "Mongo-free" claim: {@code ditto.mongodb} legitimately remains in the loaded config —
 * {@code search.conf} ships its own Mongo defaults for when the Postgres profile is NOT opted in, and the opt-in
 * profile only SWAPS {@code search-persistence-provider}; it does not (and must not) delete unrelated Mongo config.
 * {@link #mongoDefaultsLegitimatelyRemainPresentAlongsideThePostgresProvider()} makes that a POSITIVE, documented
 * assertion rather than leaving it as an unstated assumption.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Config loading — real files, not copies</h3>
 * {@code postgres-search-lint-test.conf} (this module's test resources) is the only test-owned file, and it contains
 * nothing but two {@code include classpath(...)} directives, in the SAME order (later wins) a real
 * {@code search-pg-dev.conf} will use (Phase H):
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@code include classpath("search")} — the REAL {@code thingsearch/service/src/main/resources/search.conf}
 *     (on this module's test classpath via the {@code ditto-thingsearch-service} test-scope dependency), carrying the
 *     Mongo-default {@code search-persistence-provider} and the {@code ditto.mongodb} block.</li>
 *     <li>{@code include classpath("ditto-postgres-search")} — the REAL, shipped opt-in profile from THIS module's own
 *     main resources, which itself pulls in {@code include classpath("ditto-postgres-client")} (postgres-client's main
 *     resources) for the shared {@code ditto.postgresql.*} client/pool/SSL defaults.</li>
 * </ol>
 * So this test proves the opt-in profile parses standalone-included on top of the search service's own defaults, using
 * the REAL production resource files at every layer.
